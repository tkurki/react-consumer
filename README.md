react-consumer
==============

An example Signal K consumer using
[React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

Installation
------------

If you haven't already, clone signalk/consumer-server.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/SignalK/consumer-server.git
```

Then

```shell
$ cd consumer-server
$ bower install signalk/react-consumer
$ npm start
```

Roadmap
-------
This is a pretty simple example and not much is planned for it. However, the
following would be useful additions.
* Better documentation (always)
* A configuration file to specify URI of Signal K server
